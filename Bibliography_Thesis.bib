	Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce optimal control algorithm for the design of pulse sequences in NMR spectroscopy. This methodology is used for designing pulse sequences that maximize the coherence transfer between coupled spins in a given specified time, minimize the relaxation effects in a given coherence transfer step or minimize the time required to produce a given unitary propagator, as desired. The application of these pulse engineering methods to design pulse sequences that are robust to experimentally important parameter variations, such as chemical shift dispersion or radiofrequency (rf) variations due to imperfections such as rf inhomogeneity is also explained.},

	Abstract = {Quantum particles are characterized, for a given preparation, by a fundamental stochasticity of their observable features, such as positions, momenta, energies, or times, e.g., times of arrival at a detector in time-of-flight experiments. In quantum theory the preparation stage is encoded in a wave function, whereas averages or statistical moments of the observables are calculated by a well-known prescription (the expectation value integral) from self-adjoint operators and their powers: this is at least the case for position, momentum, or energy. In fact, the entire statistical distributions are given by the square modulus of the overlap of the wave function with the corresponding eigenstates.},

@article{Potton2004,
	Abstract = {The application of reciprocity principles in optics has a long history that goes back to Stokes, Lorentz, Helmholtz and others. Moreover, optical applications need to be seen in the context of applications of reciprocity in particle scattering, acoustics, seismology and the solution of inverse problems, generally. In some of these other fields vector wave propagation is, as it is in optics, of the essence. For this reason the simplified approach to light wave polarization developed by, and named for, Jones is explored initially to see how and to what extent it encompasses reciprocity. The characteristic matrix of a uniform dielectric layer, used in the analysis of interference filters and mirrors, is reciprocal except when the layer is magneto-optical. The way in which the reciprocal nature of a characteristic matrix can be recognized is discussed next. After this, work on the influence of more realistic attributes of a dielectric stack on reciprocity is reviewed. Some of the numerous technological applications of magneto-optic non-reciprocal media are identified and the potential of a new class of non-reciprocal components is briefly introduced. Finally, the extension of the classical reciprocity concept to systems containing components that have nonlinear optical response is briefly mentioned.},

	Abstract = {Optical systems combining balanced loss and gain provide a unique platform to implement classical analogues of quantum systems described by non-Hermitian parity--time (PT)-symmetric Hamiltonians. Such systems can be used to create synthetic materials with properties that cannot be attained in materials having only loss or only gain. Here we report PT-symmetry breaking in coupled optical resonators. We observed non-reciprocity in the PT-symmetry-breaking phase due to strong field localization, which significantly enhances nonlinearity. In the linear regime, light transmission is reciprocal regardless of whether the symmetry is broken or unbroken. We show that in one direction there is a complete absence of resonance peaks whereas in the other direction the transmission is resonantly enhanced, a feature directly associated with the use of resonant structures. Our results could lead to a new generation of synthetic optical systems enabling on-chip manipulation and control of light propagation.},

Nonreciprocal light transport and one-way photonic mode conversion are demonstrated at the wavelength of 1.55 micrometers in both simulations and experiments.

	Abstract = {A non-Abelian group of 16 symmetry operations on (generally) non-Hermitian discrete Hamiltonians represented by matrices is studied. The symmetry operations are described by unitary/antiunitary superoperators that arise when combining three basic generating operations with simple `geometric' interpretations. The corresponding Hamiltonian symmetries occur when the Hamiltonian remains invariant under the superoperator action. These symmetries include PT-symmetry and Hermiticity as particular cases. The interplay between the group of symmetry operations and Hamiltonian symmetries is analyzed systematically by introducing the concepts of equivalent operations and associated symmetries. Spectral properties implied by some of the symmetries are described.},

	Abstract = {Recent work provides a general two-step solution to trapping and cooling of atoms. The first step is magnetic stopping of paramagnetic atoms with the use of a sequence of pulsed fields. The second step is single-photon cooling, which is based on a one-way barrier. This cooling method is related intimately to the historic problem of {\textquotedblleft}Maxwell{\textquoteright}s Demon{\textquotedblright} and subsequent work by L. Szilard. Here, I discuss the connections between single-photon cooling and information entropy. I also outline future application of these methods to fundamental tests with hydrogen isotopes.},

	Abstract = {We describe the statistical mechanics of a new method to produce
very cold atoms or molecules. The method results from trapping a
gas in a potential well, and sweeping through the well a
semi-permeable barrier, one that allows particles to leave but
not to return. If the sweep is sufficiently slow, all the
particles trapped in the well compress into a very cold gas. We
derive analytical expressions for the velocity distribution of
particles in the cold gas, compare these results with numerical
simulations, and discuss limitations on reduction in energy due
to imperfections of the barrier.},

	Abstract = {Different decay behaviours of the survival probability are examined. Technically, the survival probability of an arbitrary state ? is determined by the ? matrix element of the resolvent of the full Hamiltonian. The analytical properties of this matrix element can be analyzed in terms of the properties of the kernel of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. For the Yamaguchi potential and several initial states, all functions are explicitly calculated. This approach allows the decomposition of the survival amplitude into a sum of decaying exponential terms and w-functions associated with the pole positions of the resolvent matrix element in the complex momentum plane. Novel decay behaviours are found for the decay of states associated with the resolvent poles and the decay of a state which is dominated by the form of the wave function rather than by the resolvent poles. Certain anomalous short time decay behaviour is also exemplified.},

	Abstract = {We discuss Hamiltonian symmetries and invariants for quantum systems driven by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. For time-independent Hermitian Hamiltonians, a unitary or antiunitary transformation AHA� that leaves the Hamiltonian H unchanged represents a symmetry of the Hamiltonian, which implies the commutativity [H,A]=0 and, if A is linear and time-independent, a conservation law, namely the invariance of expectation values of A. For non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, H� comes into play as a distinct operator that complements H in generalized unitarity relations. The above description of symmetries has to be extended to include also A-pseudohermiticity relations of the form AH=H�A. A superoperator formulation of Hamiltonian symmetries is provided and exemplified for Hamiltonians of a particle moving in one-dimension considering the set of A operators that form Klein�s 4-group: parity, time-reversal, parity&amp;time-reversal, and unity. The link between symmetry and conservation laws is discussed and shown to be richer and subtler for non-Hermitian than for Hermitian Hamiltonians.},

Together with related concepts of non-Hermitian physics of open quantum systems, such as non-Hermitian degeneracies (exceptional points) and spectral singularities,  symmetry represents one among the most fruitful ideas introduced in optics in the past few years. Judicious tailoring of optical gain and loss in integrated photonic structures has emerged as a new paradigm in shaping the flow of light in unprecedented ways, with major applications encompassing laser science and technology, optical sensing, and optical material engineering. In this perspective, I review some of the main achievements and emerging areas of -symmetric and non-Hermtian photonics, and provide an outline of challenges and directions for future research in one of the fastest growing research area of photonics.},

	Abstract = {The reciprocity principle is that, when an emitted wave gets scattered on an object, the scattering transition amplitude does not change if we interchange the source and the detector---in other words, if incoming waves are interchanged with appropriate outgoing ones. Reciprocity is sometimes confused with time reversal invariance, or with invariance under the rotation that interchanges the location of the source and the location of the detector. Actually, reciprocity covers the former as a special case, and is fundamentally different from--but can be usefully combined with--the latter. Reciprocity can be proved as a theorem in many situations and is found violated in other cases. The paper presents a general treatment of reciprocity, discusses important examples, shows applications in the field of photon (M{\"o}ssbauer) scattering, and establishes a fruitful connection with a recently developing area of mathematics.},

	Abstract = {Quantum adiabatic processes---that keep constant the populations in the instantaneous eigenbasis of a time-dependent Hamiltonian---are very useful to prepare and manipulate states, but take typically a long time. This is often problematic because decoherence and noise may spoil the desired final state, or because some applications require many repetitions. ``Shortcuts to adiabaticity'' are alternative fast processes which reproduce the same final populations, or even the same final state, as the adiabatic process in a finite, shorter time. Since adiabatic processes are ubiquitous, the shortcuts span a broad range of applications in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, such as fast transport of ions or neutral atoms, internal population control, and state preparation (for nuclear magnetic resonance or quantum information), cold atom expansions and other manipulations, cooling cycles, wavepacket splitting, and many-body state engineering or correlations microscopy. Shortcuts are also relevant to clarify fundamental questions such as a precise quantification of the third principle of thermodynamics and quantum speed limits. We review different theoretical techniques proposed to engineer the shortcuts, the experimental results, and the prospects.},

We investigate bifurcations of stationary nonlinear modes from the eigenstates of the linear operator and consider a class of -symmetric nonlinearities allowing the existence of families of nonlinear modes. We pay particular attention to situations when the underlying linear -symmetric operator is characterized by the presence of degenerate eigenvalues or an exceptional-point singularity. In each of the cases we construct formal expansions for small-amplitude nonlinear modes. We also report a class of nonlinearities allowing the system to admit one or several integrals of motion, which turn out to be determined by the pseudo-hermiticity of the nonlinear operator.},

	Abstract = {The scattering of quantum particles by non-Hermitian (generally non-local) potentials in one dimension may result in asymmetric transmission and/or reflection from left and right incidence. After extending the concept of symmetry for non-Hermitian potentials, eight generalized symmetries based on the discrete Klein's four-group (formed by parity, time reversal, their product, and unity) are found. Together with generalized unitarity relations they determine selection rules for the possible and/or forbidden scattering asymmetries. Six basic device types are identified when the scattering coefficients (squared moduli of scattering amplitudes) adopt zero/one values, and transmission and/or reflection are asymmetric. They can pictorically be described as a one-way mirror, a one-way barrier (a Maxwell pressure demon), one-way (transmission or reflection) filters, a mirror with unidirectional transmission, and a transparent, one-way reflector. We design potentials for these devices and also demonstrate that the behavior of the scattering coefficients can be extended to a broad range of incident momenta.},

@article{Feshbach1958,
	Abstract = {A new formulation of the theory of nuclear reactions based on the properties of a generalized ``optical'' potential is presented. The real and imaginary part of this potential satisfy a dispersion type relation while its poles give rise to resonances in nuclear reactions. A new derivation of the Breit-Wigner formula is given in which the concept of channel radius is not employed. This derivation is extended to the case of overlapping resonances. These results can then be employed to obtain the complex potential well model for pure elastic scattering. This potential well is shown to become real as the average width of the resonances increases. Reactions as well as elastic scattering are treated. Considering the former process in an isolated resonance, we obtain a nonresonant term analogous to the familiar potential scattering term of elastic scattering. This is just the direct interaction term which thus appears automatically in this formalism. Upon performing the appropriate energy averages over resonances, the complex potential well model is generalized so as to include inelastic scattering. The effects of the identity of nucleons is investigated. It is shown that our formalism is valid as long as the exit channels can at most contain one nucleon.},

@article{Feshbach1962,
	Abstract = {The effective Hamiltonian method for nuclear reactions described in an earlier paper with the same title, part I, is generalized so as to include all possible reaction types, as well as the effects arising from the identity of particles. The principal device employed, as in part I, is the projection operator which selects the open channel components of the wave function. It is found that the formal structure of part I providing a unified description for direct and compound nuclear reactions including the coupled equation description for direct reactions remains valid in this wider context. A Kapur-Peierls expansion may also be readily obtained. The concept of channel radii is not needed nor is any decomposition of the wave function for the system into angular momentum eigenstates required, so that the expressions for transition amplitudes and widths are invariant with respect to the angular momentum coupling scheme. Since the open channels can only be defined in an asymptotic sense, the corresponding projection operators are not unique. As a consequence the projection operator method has a flexibility which in the first place is consonant with the wide range of phenomena which can occur in nuclear reactions and in the second place can effectively exploit an intuitive understanding of the phenomena. Example of projection operators are obtained including one which leads to the Wigner-Eisenbud formalism, another which is appropriate for the stripping reaction, and, finally, one which takes the Pauli exclusion principle into account. Note that explicit representations of the projection operators are not required for the development of general formal results but are necessary if, eventually, quantitative calculations are made.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new class of parity-time ()-symmetric complex crystals which are almost transparent and one-way reflectionless over a broad frequency range around the Bragg frequency, i.e., unidirectionally invisible, regardless of the thickness L of the crystal. The -symmetric complex crystal is synthesized by a supersymmetric (SUSY) transformation of a Hermitian square well potential, and exact analytical expressions of transmission and reflection coefficients are given. As L is increased, the transmittance and reflectance from one side remain close to one and zero, respectively, whereas the reflectance from the other side secularly grows like owing to unidirectional Bragg scattering. This is a distinctive feature as compared to the previously studied case of the complex sinusoidal -symmetric potential at the symmetry breaking point, where transparency breaks down as .},

	Abstract = {In the framework of the ordinary non-relativistic quantum mechanics, it is known that a quantum particle in a rapidly oscillating bound potential with vanishing time average can be scattered off or even trapped owing to the phenomenon of dynamical (Kapitza) stabilization. A similar phenomenon occurs for scattering and trapping of optical waves. Such a remarkable result stems from the fact that, even though the particle is not able to follow the rapid external oscillations of the potential, these are still able to affect the average dynamics by means of an effective ---albeit small--- nonvanishing potential contribution. Here we consider the scattering and dynamical stabilization problem for matter or classical waves by a bound potential with oscillating ac amplitude f(t) in the framework of a non-Hermitian extension of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, and predict that for a wide class of imaginary amplitude modulations f(t) possessing a one-sided Fourier spectrum, the oscillating potential is effectively canceled, i.e., it does not have any effect on the particle dynamics, contrary to what happens in the Hermitian case.},

	Abstract = {We review the construction and use of complex potentials in reactive scattering and other molecular collisions to calculate continuum quantities (such as state-to-state transition probabilities, cumulative reaction probabilities, or resonance characteristics) with finite grid or finite basis methods. The success of the approach is greatly based on its simplicity. In general these potentials are adjusted phenomenologically or optimized for achieving an absorptive and non-reflecting boundary. For further progress the conceptual and formal framework of the complex potentials and the efficiency of their numerical implementation must be investigated more deeply. We present along this line a formal theory of scattering for complex potentials in one dimension, as well as a detailed account of the functional forms and construction methods proposed. We also demonstrate that part of the acquired knowledge may be transferred to ``physical'' absorbing potentials, i.e., effective interactions that can be tailored physically (rather than numerically) to accomplish e.g. an improved atomic detection by fluorescence.},

	Abstract = {Many classes of non-parity-time (PT)-symmetric waveguides with arbitrary gain and loss distributions still possess all-real linear spectrum or exhibit phase transition. In this Letter, nonlinear light behaviors in these complex waveguides are probed analytically near a phase transition. Using multi-scale perturbation methods, a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) is derived for the light's amplitude evolution. This ODE predicts that a single class of these non-PT-symmetric waveguides supports soliton families and amplitude-oscillating solutions both above and below linear phase transition, in close analogy with PT-symmetric systems. For the other classes of waveguides, the light's intensity always amplifies under the effect of nonlinearity, even if the waveguide is below the linear phase transition. These analytical predictions are confirmed by direct computations of the full system.},

	Abstract = {A perturbation analysis of nonlinear inversion is presented. As a prototype of nonlinear inversion, inverse scattering with the Marchenko equation is considered from a perturbative point of view. It is shown that inverse scattering methods using the Marchenko equation implicitly reconstruct the potential by removing the nonlinearities from the data, and by performing a Born inversion of the resulting linear component in the data (the first Born approximation). This is illustrated with a one-dimensional example. This interpretation of the mechanism of inverse scattering algorithms clarifies the 'miracle of Newton', and has profound consequences for both the theoretical and the practical aspects of inverse scattering, in particular for the stability of inverse scattering schemes.},

The need to overcome this difficulty is becoming increasingly urgent, especially with the emergence of silicon nano-photonics2,3,4, which promises to create on-chip optical systems at an unprecedented scale of integration. Until now, there have been no techniques that provide complete on-chip signal isolation using materials or processes that are fundamentally compatible with silicon CMOS processes. Based on the effects of photonic transitions5,6, we show here that a linear, broadband and non-reciprocal isolation can be accomplished by spatial--temporal refractive index modulations that simultaneously impart frequency and wavevector shifts during the photonic transition process. We further show that a non-reciprocal effect can be accomplished in dynamically modulated micrometre-scale ring-resonator structures. This work demonstrates that on-chip isolation can be accomplished with dynamic photonic structures in standard material systems that are widely used for integrated optoelectronic applications.},

Small-amplitude solitons are found in explicit form. The combined effect of gain-and-loss and dispersive coupling results in several interesting features which include a separation between the components in different arms, nontrivial dependence of stability of a soliton on its velocity, and the existence of more complex stationary two-hump solutions.

It talks about new classes of quantum bound states and their probabilistic interpretations. Simplified Schr{\"o}dinger equations are among the innovations in mathematical physics discussed in this chapter. The Homer's story about the six-headed monster Scylla which, together with the all-destroying whirlpool of Charybdis is reviewed. No surprise that in the mythology of old Greeks the fabulous Odysseus followed the advise by Kirke and that, in order to avoid the deadly Charybdis, he rather sacrificed six of his men to Scylla while saving the rest. The story of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in quantum physics presents a message that allows us to reclassify the Bender's and Boettcher's apparent acceptance of the Charybdis-resembling evils of nonunitarity in 1998 as a promising and well-working strategy. At present, a new round of attempted amendments of the formulation of the theory has started.},

	Abstract = {Isolating ions and atoms from the environment is essential in experiments on a quantum level1,2,3,4. For decades, this has been achieved by trapping ions with radiofrequency5 fields and neutral particles with optical fields6. Here we demonstrate the trapping of an ion by interaction with light. The lifetime in the optical trap is several milliseconds, allowing hundreds of oscillations in the optical potential, and could be enhanced by established methods6. These results could form the starting point for combining the advantages of optical trapping and ions. Extending the approach to optical lattices could support developments in experimental quantum simulations7. As well as simulating complex spin systems with trapped ions, a new class of quantum simulations could be enabled that combines atoms and ions in a common lattice (Cirac, J.I., personal communication; Zoller, P., personal communication). Furthermore, ions could be embedded into quantum degenerate gases, thereby avoiding the inevitable excess kinetic energy of ions in radiofrequency traps, which currently limits cold-chemistry experiments8,9.},

	Abstract = {We investigate electrode geometries required to produce periodic two-dimensional ion-trap arrays with the ions placed between two planes of electrodes. We present a generalization of previous methods for traps containing a single electrode plane to this new geometry, and show that for a given ion-electrode distance and applied voltages, the inter-ion distance can be reduced by a factor of up to 3 relative to single-plane traps. This represents an increase by a factor of 9 in the trap density and a factor of 27 in the exchange coupling between the oscillatory motion of neighboring ions. The resulting traps are also considerably deeper for bi-layer structures than for single-plane traps. These results could offer a useful path towards two-dimensional ion arrays for quantum simulation. We also discuss issues with the fabrication of such traps.},

@article{Cirac2000,
	Abstract = {Quantum computers require the storage of quantum information in a set of two-level systems (called qubits), the processing of this information using quantum gates and a means of final readout1. So far, only a few systems have been identified as potentially viable quantum computer models---accurate quantum control of the coherent evolution is required in order to realize gate operations, while at the same time decoherence must be avoided. Examples include quantum optical systems (such as those utilizing trapped ions2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or neutral atoms10,11,12, cavity quantum electrodynamics13,14,15 and nuclear magnetic resonance16,17) and solid state systems (using nuclear spins1,18, quantum dots19 and Josephson junctions20). The most advanced candidates are the quantum optical and nuclear magnetic resonance systems, and we expect that they will allow quantum computing with about ten qubits within the next few years. This is still far from the numbers required for useful applications: for example, the factorization of a 200-digit number requires about 3,500 qubits21, rising to 100,000 if error correction22 is implemented. Scalability of proposed quantum computer architectures to many qubits is thus of central importance. Here we propose a model for an ion trap quantum computer that combines scalability (a feature usually associated with solid state proposals) with the advantages of quantum optical systems (in particular, quantum control and long decoherence times).},

	Abstract = {We experimentally study energy transport in chains of trapped ions. We use a pulsed excitation scheme to rapidly add energy to the local motional mode of one of the ions in the chain. Subsequent energy readout allows us to determine how the excitation has propagated throughout the chain. We observe energy revivals that persist for many cycles. We study the behavior with an increasing number of ions of up to 37 in the chain, including a zig-zag configuration. The experimental results agree with the theory of normal mode evolution. The described system provides an experimental toolbox for the study of thermodynamics of closed systems and energy transport in both classical and quantum regimes.},

@article{Freitas2015,
	Abstract = {We study the thermodynamical properties of crystals of trapped ions which are laser cooled to two different temperatures in two separate regions. We show that these properties strongly depend on the structure of the ion crystal. Such structure can be changed by varying the trap parameters and undergoes a series of phase transitions from linear to zig-zag or helicoidal configurations. Thus, we show that these systems are ideal candidates to observe and control the transition from anomalous to normal heat transport. All structures behave as `heat superconductors', with a thermal conductivity increasing linearly with system size and a vanishing thermal gradient inside the system. However, zig-zag and helicoidal crystals turn out to be hyper sensitive to disorder having a linear temperature profile and a length independent conductivity. Interestingly, disordered 2D ion crystals are heat insulators. Sensitivity to disorder is much smaller in the 1D case.},

	Abstract = {We provide convincing empirical evidence that long-range interactions strongly enhance the rectification effect which takes place in mass graded systems. Even more importantly the rectification does not decrease with the increase of the system size. Large rectification is obtained also for the equal-mass case and with graded on-site potential. These results allow to overcome current limitations of the rectification mechanism and open the way for a realistic implementation of efficient thermal diodes.},

@article{Zhang2015,
	Abstract = {The realization of phononic computing is held hostage by the lack of high-performance thermal devices. Here, it is shown through theoretical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations that unprecedented thermal rectification factors (as large as 1.20) can be achieved utilizing the phase-dependent thermal conductivity of polyethylene nanofibers. More importantly, such high thermal rectifications only need very small temperature differences (<20 {\^A}$\,^{\circ}$C) across the device, which is a significant advantage over other thermal diodes which need temperature biases on the order of the operating temperature. Taking this into consideration, it is shown that the dimensionless temperature-scaled rectification factors of the polymer nanofiber diodes range from 12 to 25{\^a}much larger than those of other thermal diodes (<8). The polymer nanofiber thermal diode consists of a crystalline portion whose thermal conductivity is highly phase-sensitive and a cross-linked portion which has a stable phase. Nanoscale size effect can be utilized to tune the phase transition temperature of the crystalline portion, enabling thermal diodes capable of operating at different temperatures. This work will be instrumental to the design of high performance, inexpensive, and easily processible thermal devices, based on which thermal circuits can be built to ultimately enable phononic computing.},

@article{Metcalf2003,
	Abstract = {A review is presented of some of the principal techniques of laser cooling and trapping that have been developed during the past 20 years. Its approach is primarily experimental, but its quantitative descriptions are consistent in notation with most of the theoretical literature. It begins with a simplified introduction to optical forces on atoms, including both cooling and trapping. Then its three main sections discuss its three selected features, (1) quantization of atomic motion, (2) effects of the multilevel structure of atoms, and (3) the effects of polychromatic light. Each of these features is an expansion in a different direction from the simplest model of a classical, two-level atom moving in a monochromatic laser field.},

@article{Pons2017,
	Abstract = {We present a chain-of-atoms model where heat is rectified, with different fluxes from the hot to the cold baths located at the chain boundaries when the temperature bias is reversed. The chain is homogeneous except for boundary effects and a local modification of the interactions at one site, the ``impurity''. The rectification mechanism is due here to the localized impurity, the only asymmetrical element of the structure, apart from the externally imposed temperature bias, and does not rely on putting in contact different materials or other known mechanisms such as grading or long-range interactions. The effect survives if all interaction forces are linear except the ones for the impurity.},

@article{Pereira2019,
	Abstract = {This mini-review addresses a bedrock problem for the advance of phononics: the building of feasible and efficient thermal diodes. We revisit investigations in classical and quantum systems. For the classical anharmonic chains of oscillators, the most used model for the study of heat conduction in insulating solids, we recall the ubiquitous occurrence of thermal rectification in graded systems, and we show that the match between graded structures and long-range interactions is an efficient mechanism to increase the rectification factor. For the cases of genuine quantum models, we present the spin chains, such as the open XXZ model, as profitable systems for the occurrence of thermal rectification and other interesting related properties. In particular, we describe two cases of perfect diodes: one for the spin current, in a two-segmented XXZ model, and another one for the heat current in a simple quantum Ising model with long-range interactions. We believe that such results involving interesting rectification properties in simple models will stimulate more theoretical and experimental investigations on the subject.},
