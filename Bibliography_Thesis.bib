	Abstract = {Isolating ions and atoms from the environment is essential in experiments on a quantum level1,2,3,4. For decades, this has been achieved by trapping ions with radiofrequency5 fields and neutral particles with optical fields6. Here we demonstrate the trapping of an ion by interaction with light. The lifetime in the optical trap is several milliseconds, allowing hundreds of oscillations in the optical potential, and could be enhanced by established methods6. These results could form the starting point for combining the advantages of optical trapping and ions. Extending the approach to optical lattices could support developments in experimental quantum simulations7. As well as simulating complex spin systems with trapped ions, a new class of quantum simulations could be enabled that combines atoms and ions in a common lattice (Cirac, J.I., personal communication; Zoller, P., personal communication). Furthermore, ions could be embedded into quantum degenerate gases, thereby avoiding the inevitable excess kinetic energy of ions in radiofrequency traps, which currently limits cold-chemistry experiments8,9.},

	Abstract = {We investigate electrode geometries required to produce periodic two-dimensional ion-trap arrays with the ions placed between two planes of electrodes. We present a generalization of previous methods for traps containing a single electrode plane to this new geometry, and show that for a given ion-electrode distance and applied voltages, the inter-ion distance can be reduced by a factor of up to 3 relative to single-plane traps. This represents an increase by a factor of 9 in the trap density and a factor of 27 in the exchange coupling between the oscillatory motion of neighboring ions. The resulting traps are also considerably deeper for bi-layer structures than for single-plane traps. These results could offer a useful path towards two-dimensional ion arrays for quantum simulation. We also discuss issues with the fabrication of such traps.},

@article{Cirac2000,
	Abstract = {Quantum computers require the storage of quantum information in a set of two-level systems (called qubits), the processing of this information using quantum gates and a means of final readout1. So far, only a few systems have been identified as potentially viable quantum computer models---accurate quantum control of the coherent evolution is required in order to realize gate operations, while at the same time decoherence must be avoided. Examples include quantum optical systems (such as those utilizing trapped ions2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or neutral atoms10,11,12, cavity quantum electrodynamics13,14,15 and nuclear magnetic resonance16,17) and solid state systems (using nuclear spins1,18, quantum dots19 and Josephson junctions20). The most advanced candidates are the quantum optical and nuclear magnetic resonance systems, and we expect that they will allow quantum computing with about ten qubits within the next few years. This is still far from the numbers required for useful applications: for example, the factorization of a 200-digit number requires about 3,500 qubits21, rising to 100,000 if error correction22 is implemented. Scalability of proposed quantum computer architectures to many qubits is thus of central importance. Here we propose a model for an ion trap quantum computer that combines scalability (a feature usually associated with solid state proposals) with the advantages of quantum optical systems (in particular, quantum control and long decoherence times).},

	Abstract = {We experimentally study energy transport in chains of trapped ions. We use a pulsed excitation scheme to rapidly add energy to the local motional mode of one of the ions in the chain. Subsequent energy readout allows us to determine how the excitation has propagated throughout the chain. We observe energy revivals that persist for many cycles. We study the behavior with an increasing number of ions of up to 37 in the chain, including a zig-zag configuration. The experimental results agree with the theory of normal mode evolution. The described system provides an experimental toolbox for the study of thermodynamics of closed systems and energy transport in both classical and quantum regimes.},

@article{Freitas2015,
	Abstract = {We study the thermodynamical properties of crystals of trapped ions which are laser cooled to two different temperatures in two separate regions. We show that these properties strongly depend on the structure of the ion crystal. Such structure can be changed by varying the trap parameters and undergoes a series of phase transitions from linear to zig-zag or helicoidal configurations. Thus, we show that these systems are ideal candidates to observe and control the transition from anomalous to normal heat transport. All structures behave as `heat superconductors', with a thermal conductivity increasing linearly with system size and a vanishing thermal gradient inside the system. However, zig-zag and helicoidal crystals turn out to be hyper sensitive to disorder having a linear temperature profile and a length independent conductivity. Interestingly, disordered 2D ion crystals are heat insulators. Sensitivity to disorder is much smaller in the 1D case.},

Even more importantly the rectification does not decrease with the increase of the system size. Large rectification is obtained also for the equal-mass case and with graded on-site potential. These results allow to overcome current limitations of the rectification mechanism and open the way for a realistic implementation of efficient thermal diodes.},

@article{Zhang2015,
	Abstract = {The realization of phononic computing is held hostage by the lack of high-performance thermal devices. Here, it is shown through theoretical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations that unprecedented thermal rectification factors (as large as 1.20) can be achieved utilizing the phase-dependent thermal conductivity of polyethylene nanofibers. More importantly, such high thermal rectifications only need very small temperature differences (<20 {\^A}$\,^{\circ}$C) across the device, which is a significant advantage over other thermal diodes which need temperature biases on the order of the operating temperature. Taking this into consideration, it is shown that the dimensionless temperature-scaled rectification factors of the polymer nanofiber diodes range from 12 to 25{\^a}much larger than those of other thermal diodes (<8). The polymer nanofiber thermal diode consists of a crystalline portion whose thermal conductivity is highly phase-sensitive and a cross-linked portion which has a stable phase. Nanoscale size effect can be utilized to tune the phase transition temperature of the crystalline portion, enabling thermal diodes capable of operating at different temperatures. This work will be instrumental to the design of high performance, inexpensive, and easily processible thermal devices, based on which thermal circuits can be built to ultimately enable phononic computing.},

@article{Metcalf2003,
	Abstract = {A review is presented of some of the principal techniques of laser cooling and trapping that have been developed during the past 20 years. Its approach is primarily experimental, but its quantitative descriptions are consistent in notation with most of the theoretical literature. It begins with a simplified introduction to optical forces on atoms, including both cooling and trapping. Then its three main sections discuss its three selected features, (1) quantization of atomic motion, (2) effects of the multilevel structure of atoms, and (3) the effects of polychromatic light. Each of these features is an expansion in a different direction from the simplest model of a classical, two-level atom moving in a monochromatic laser field.},

@article{Pons2017,
	Abstract = {We present a chain-of-atoms model where heat is rectified, with different fluxes from the hot to the cold baths located at the chain boundaries when the temperature bias is reversed. The chain is homogeneous except for boundary effects and a local modification of the interactions at one site, the ``impurity''. The rectification mechanism is due here to the localized impurity, the only asymmetrical element of the structure, apart from the externally imposed temperature bias, and does not rely on putting in contact different materials or other known mechanisms such as grading or long-range interactions. The effect survives if all interaction forces are linear except the ones for the impurity.},

@article{Pereira2019,
	Abstract = {This mini-review addresses a bedrock problem for the advance of phononics: the building of feasible and efficient thermal diodes. We revisit investigations in classical and quantum systems. For the classical anharmonic chains of oscillators, the most used model for the study of heat conduction in insulating solids, we recall the ubiquitous occurrence of thermal rectification in graded systems, and we show that the match between graded structures and long-range interactions is an efficient mechanism to increase the rectification factor. For the cases of genuine quantum models, we present the spin chains, such as the open XXZ model, as profitable systems for the occurrence of thermal rectification and other interesting related properties. In particular, we describe two cases of perfect diodes: one for the spin current, in a two-segmented XXZ model, and another one for the heat current in a simple quantum Ising model with long-range interactions. We believe that such results involving interesting rectification properties in simple models will stimulate more theoretical and experimental investigations on the subject.},
